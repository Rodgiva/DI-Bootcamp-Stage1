            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Adrian von Ziegler is a Swiss composer from ZÃ¼rich. He gained popularity on the video-sharing website
                YouTube, where his channel has over 1,000,000 subscribers as of May 2021. He composes instrumental music
                with a variety of Celtic Music, Emotional Music, Relaxing Music, Dark Music, Oriental Music, Fantasy
                Music, Movie Scores, Metal and many other genres. </p>
            <h2>Musical career</h2>

            <p>At age 15, von Ziegler began his musical experience as a drummer in a local rock band. However, wanting
                more melodic expression, he quit the band and started to compose music independently, using only a
                headset microphone and guitar.</p>

            <p>From 2007 to 2009, he recorded countless demo songs under the artist name "Indigo", in which his guitar
                would get replaced increasingly often by keyboard and orchestral arrangements of which he grew to favor.
                In 2008, he began releasing music on the social networking site Myspace.</p>

            <p>After dropping the Indigo pseudonym in 2009, he began releasing music under his own name, starting with
                the albums Requiem and Lifeclock in 2010. </p>
